## HiðŸ‘‹, I am Artificial Intelligence engineer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³   
 i am studying in shivajirao jhondale college of engineering (Mumbai University)
 
## About me:

I am Ayush Ravindra Vaidande, a highly motivated Deep Learning Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with honors. My academic journey at Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering has been complemented by extensive hands-on experience in diverse projects encompassing Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and other AI domains. Proficient in Python and C++, I bring a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of AI.

During my academic pursuits, I undertook internships in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Python, refining my skills and gaining valuable industry exposure. My keen interest in large language models culminated in my final year project, where I developed "Fine-tuned Llama 2 7B with Therapy Dataset." This project not only showcased my proficiency but also demonstrated my commitment to pushing the boundaries of language modeling.

Passionate about the intersection of technology and language, I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects and furthering my expertise in the field of Deep Learning and AI.
